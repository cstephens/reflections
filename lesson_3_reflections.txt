Q:  When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A:  When you intend on working on the code base from multiple devices or when you are worried about the safety of only keeping a local copy.

Q:  Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

A:  You might not want to deal with conflicts until you are ready to push your changes.  You also don't want your local code base changing out from under you.

Q:  Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A:  A fork is a clone within githum.  A clone is a copy of a git repository.  A brance is label tagged to a commit that represents a starting point of code changes that can be tracked back to the beginning of the project.

Q:  What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

A:  One benefit would be if you were going to be offline for a while and wanted to continue making progress on the code in your repository.

Q:  How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

A:  You'd have to bundle up all the files in the project and share them through some mechanism.  You'd also have to figure out how to manage versions.  Pretty much everything would be harder.
